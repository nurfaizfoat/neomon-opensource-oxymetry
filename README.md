**NEOMON** is an ESP8266 (Wireless MCU) and MAX30100 (IR Sensor) powered open source wearable-ready device. Its primary usage is to monitor newborn vital signs namely Heartbeat (BPM), SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation) and also Body Temperature (°C/°F). These vital signs are the first line in pneumonia diagnosis and treatment in newborn babies. It can also be configured to act as a realtime oximeter for your newborn during sleeping hour to prevent SIDS (Sudden Infant Death).

Being an open source project, NEOMON is designed to be easy reproduce-able by anyone interested. Use cases are targeted for poor, hard-to-reach communities and by low-skilled care providers. i.e Conflict Zone, War-torn countries, Disaster Area. Its Bill of Materials (BOM) are also has to be kept reasonable (MYR300 @ USD$75) each.

## Getting Started

Start collecting all the part
   If you have a reliable Internet connection, you should use the online IDE (Arduino Web Editor). It will allow you to save your sketches in the cloud, having them available from any device and backed up. You will always have the most up-to-date version of the IDE without the need to install updates or community generated libraries.

2. If you would rather work offline, you should use the latest version of the desktop IDE
## Sketch


If you use npm, `npm install d3`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/d3/). For example:
