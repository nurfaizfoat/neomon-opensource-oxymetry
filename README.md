**NEOMON** is an ESP8266 (Wireless MCU) and MAX30100 (IR Sensor) powered open source wearable-ready device. Its primary usage is to monitor newborn vital signs namely Heartbeat (BPM), SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation) and also Body Temperature (°C/°F). These vital signs are the first line in pneumonia diagnosis and treatment in newborn babies. It can also be configured to act as a realtime oximeter for your newborn during sleeping hour to prevent SIDS (Sudden Infant Death).

Being an open source project, NEOMON is designed to be easy reproduce-able by anyone interested. Use cases are targeted for poor, hard-to-reach communities and by low-skilled care providers. i.e Conflict Zone, War-torn countries, Disaster Area. Its Bill of Materials (BOM) are also has to be kept reasonable (MYR300 @ USD$75) each.

## Getting Started
Running NEOMON on an ESP8266 MCU is the quickest way to get you hand on this project. The easiest way to kickstart your development is to get Arduino Environment running in your machine. Our friend at Arduino.cc had created a very concise tutorial on this LINK.
