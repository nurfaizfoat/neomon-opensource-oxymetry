![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/zS2aS2z.jpg "NEOMON on Breadboard")

**NEOMON** is an ESP8266 (Wireless MCU) and MAX30100 (IR Sensor) powered open source wearable-ready device. Its primary usage is to monitor newborn vital signs namely Heartbeat (BPM), SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation) and also Body Temperature (°C/°F). These vital signs are the first line in pneumonia diagnosis and treatment in newborn babies.

Being an open source project, NEOMON is designed to be easy reproduce-able by anyone interested. Use cases are primarily targeted for poor, hard-to-reach communities and by low-skilled care providers. i.e Conflict Zone, War-torn countries, Disaster Area. Its Bill of Materials (BOM) are also has to be kept reasonable (MYR300 @ USD$75).
